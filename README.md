Root growth in the rice plant is characterized by a distinct rotational motion called circumnutation. Researchers want to better understand this process. Experimental data was collected on the developing roots of two strains of rice plants, one a wild type (WT) variety and the other a mutant (MU) variety that lacks circumnutation. In particular, cell length and position measurements were collected on cells on the inner and outer curves of a sample of roots representing the two genetic strains. The protocol utilized in this study is as follows: First, the mid–line on the central slice of a root and its point of maximum curvature are identified. Then, the lengths of the cells on the inner and outer curves of the root slice are measured and recorded for those cells falling in a window around the point of maximum curvature. This process was repeated on nine WT and eleven MU genotype roots. By understanding the differences in growth based on side and genotype, researchers can gain a better understanding of circumnutation and rice plants.
